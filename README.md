<h1>Creating a Storage Account Within Azure</h1>
In this tutorial, we will create a resource group and create a storage account inside of a resource group. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 (21H2)

  <h2>Actions and Observations</h2>


 1.) Our first task will be to create a resource group in order to create the storage account. After we have created our resource group, we will proceed to create the storage account.
<p>

Navigate to the resource page and create a resource group

1.) You will need to name the resource group, along with any associated tags that you wish to include in the resource group, before creating it.

3.)The third step is to make sure you are deleting resource groups because forgetting to do so could result in you having to pay a fee depending on which subscription you are subscribed to. 

Congratulations! You have learned how to create a storage account and a resource group with Azure.
