<h1>Creating a Storage Account Within Azure</h1>
In this tutorial, we will create a resource group and create a storage account inside of a resource group. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 (21H2)

  <h2>Actions and Observations</h2>


 1.) The first thing we are going to do is create a resource group so we can create our storage account. Once we have our resource group made we then want to make our first Storage Account.

Navigate to the resource page and create a resource group
